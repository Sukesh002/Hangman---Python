# Hangman---Python
This is a simple command-line Hangman game developed using Python. The game randomly selects a word, and the player must guess it one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
