# Hangman---Python
This is a simple command-line Hangman game developed using Python. The game randomly selects a word, and the player must guess it one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts. 

For each wrong guess, a new hangman stage is displayed.

The project contains two Python files:

A main file that holds the game logic

A stages file that contains the ASCII art for hangman stages

Both files are required to run the game successfully.

# How to Run the Project
Download both Python files from this repository.

Place both files in the same folder.

Open the folder in VS Code or any Python compiler.

# Game Outcome

Player wins by guessing the correct word.

Player loses when all attempts are used.


# Note :
In this file it has only three to four fruits name's as you can add many more or can change it
